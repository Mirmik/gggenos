/**
 * @file
 * @brief Common array utilities and spread arrays.
 * @details
 * TODO array_foreach general overview. -- Eldar
 *     <b>Spread array</b> is statically allocated array, which is initialized
 * (populated) in multiple compilation units. In other words you can define the
 * array itself in one unit and add elements to it in another unit. Except for
 * the way of definition and initialization, spread array is usual array, so
 * it can be declared and used at run time in regular manner.
 *
 *     Just alike for usual arrays there are two general approaches for
 * iterating over (or determining size of) spread array.
 *  - At compile time using the array name. See #ARRAY_SPREAD_SIZE().
 *  - At run time for those array which has a special element at the end of
 * array so-called terminator element (e.g. @c NULL). See
 * #ARRAY_SPREAD_DEF_TERMINATED().
 *
 *     Considering current use cases and some implementation issues, spread
 * arrays are always allocated in read-only data section as if you have defined
 * a regular array with @c const modifier (although you might not have to). To
 * prevent confusion and to take advantage of compiler type checking <b>always
 * include @c const modifier to element type</b> when defining spread array
 * with #ARRAY_SPREAD_DEF() and its derivatives or when declaring it using
 * @c extern.
